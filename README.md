# Animal Selector

Step 1: Grab the buttons from the HTML using `querySelector` and console.log them to make sure it worked

Step 2: Add event listeners to each button and console.log to make sure it worked

Step 3: Grab the `show` div and the `curAnimal` span (this can be done at the top of your script)

Step 4a: Use `.innerHTML` to put the name of the animal inside the `curAnimal` span

Step 4b: Use `.innerHTML` to put a new `<img ...>` tag inside the `show` div to change the image

Step 5: Change the HTML text to match the animals that you chose (ie: replace 'Animal 1' with your animal)

Step 6: Add better style to your website so it looks cool

**Extra Extensions:** 

- Add more buttons with more animal choices
- Look up the `filter` CSS property and play around with that
- Add another span that has a description of the animal and updates to whatever animal is clicked
